# sudi-ML-speech-tagger


Used Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi algorithm to label each word in a sentence from a database or user input with its part of speech at a 95% accuracy rate.

A part of speech (POS) tagger labels each word in a sentence with its part of speech (noun, verb, etc.). A single word can have different tags in different contexts; e.g., "present" could be a verb ("I'd like to present you with this opportunity to write some great code"); an adjective ("it'll be easier if you're present at section meeting"); or a noun ("no time like the present to get started on it"). A good tagger makes use of the context to disambiguate the possibilities and determine the correct label. The tagging is in turn a core part of having a "Sudi" understand what a sentence means and how to respond.
